# GATv2_Implementation
 
My personal implementaton of GATv2 for CS6208 Paper Review.

GATv2 is an improvement over the original Graph Attention Network (GAT) which introduces a dynamic graph attention variant that is strictly more expressive than GAT's static attention.

GATv2 was proposed in the paper "How attentive are graph attention networks?" by S. Brody et al. as a conference paper in ICLR 2022.
